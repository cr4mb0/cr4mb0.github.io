Ashes of the Burning Fruit
------------------------------
The moon hung low, a jaundiced eye,
O’er fields where shadows dared not lie,
And in the vale where whispers creep,
The townsfolk stirred from fitful sleep.

A pact long lost, now writ in flame,
They dared to speak the pepper’s name—
Not bell, nor cayenne’s crimson kiss,
But fruit from realms where terror twists.

In mortar black, with hands unclean,
They crushed the pods of blistered sheen,
And chanted tongues from books long banned,
As smoke rose red from trembling land.

The air grew hot, the stars withdrew,
As something vast came crawling through—
A taste of hell, a scent of dread,
With tendrils shaped like serpent’s head.

No beast of earth nor spawn of sea,
Could match its spice-born sorcery;
Its breath, a fire of cursed design,
Made madness bloom in pain devine.

The quartz moon cracked with silent shame,
As sanity dissolved in zephyr flame.
The price for spice too great to pay,
Yet still they crave it to this day.

So heed, ye brave, the old refrain—
Lest peppers call the Fiend again.
